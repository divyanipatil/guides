## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook helps you create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and rich text.   
 
You can use it for:
* data cleaning and transformation
* numerical simulation
* statistical modeling
* data visualization
* machine learning

The Jupyter notebook combines two components:

### A web application:  

The Jupyter Notebook App helps to edit and run notebook documents in a web browser,  combining explanatory text, mathematics, computations and rich media.

### Notebook document:

The Jupyter Notebook App can create a 'Notebook document' containing both code and rich text elements. A Notebook document can be both readable and executable.

These documents are produced by the Jupyter Notebook App.

## Jupyter Notebook App
As a server-client application, the Jupyter Notebook App allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser.  
The application can be executed on a PC without Internet access or it can be installed on a remote server, where you can access it through the Internet.  

Its two main components are the kernels and a dashboard.

### Kernels
A kernel is a program that runs and introspects the userâ€™s code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also kernels available for other programming languages.

### Dashboard
The dashboard of the application not only shows you the notebook documents that you have made and can reopen but can also be used to manage the kernels: you can which ones are running and shut them down if necessary.
