## Jupyter Notebook


In this case, "notebook" or "notebook documents" denote documents that contain both code and rich text elements, such as figures, links, equations...  
Because of the mix of code and text elements, these documents are the ideal place to bring together an analysis description and its results as well as they can be executed perform the data analysis in real time.

These documents are produced by the Jupyter Notebook App.
## Jupyter Notebook App
As a server-client application, the Jupyter Notebook App allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser.  
The application can be executed on a PC without Internet access or it can be installed on a remote server, where you can access it through the Internet.  

Its two main components are the kernels and a dashboard.
### Kernels
A kernel is a program that runs and introspects the userâ€™s code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also kernels available for other programming languages.
### Dashboard
The dashboard of the application not only shows you the notebook documents that you have made and can reopen but can also be used to manage the kernels: you can which ones are running and shut them down if necessary.
